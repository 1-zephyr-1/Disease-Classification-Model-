# Disease-Classification-Model-
It's a classification model that can detect plant diseases with an accuracy of 99.8% over 10 epocs
It's coded in python and I would suggest you use google colab to run it.
While running make sure that your runtime is set to t4 GPU and not the cpu as the cpu takes a long time to compile the code.
Thank you for checking my code.
